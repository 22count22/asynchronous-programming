## Before this Module

In the previous module ([encapsulation](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/encapsulation), 3 weeks) students learned how `this`, the prototype type chain and Classes work in JS. They also learned how to encapsulate components of their UI into reactive classes.

## After this Module

In the next module ([web-apps](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/web-apps), 4 weeks) students will learn how to build simple fullstack applications that read/write data from the file system. Along the way they will learn about Express (routing, middleware, error handling, ...), RESTful APIs, Postman, simple deployment, data validation, using NPM modules, and much much more.

Frontends in the Web Apps module are the same as what they learned in the Async module, just served statically from the root of their APIs.

Web Apps is the magic module where everything the students have learned at HYF pulls together into the big picture.
